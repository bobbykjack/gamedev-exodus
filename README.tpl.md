# The Gaming Exodus

## About

This is a list of **{NUM_ACCOUNTS}** accounts related to video gaming in some way: developers, artists, streamers, journalists, etc. Most are people I’ve followed on Twitter, and all have a Mastodon account.

You may find this useful when setting up your own Mastodon account and looking for people to follow. 

## The List

{ACCOUNT_TABLE}

## More

The list is pretty small right now. I’m doing my best to add to it day-by-day, as more people sign up to Mastodon. Please bear with me as I turn this into, hopefully, a useful resource.

If you’re on this list, but you don’t want to be, please accept my apologies. Just let me know and I’ll remove you.

If you spot any mistakes, please let me know and I’ll rectify them.

If you’re not on this list, but feel like you qualify, [give me a shout](https://mas.to/@bobbyjackdotme) and I’ll probably add you.

Of course, feel free to open a pull request (on [accounts.json](accounts.json), please) if you want to make the process as easy as possible for me!
